Evaluation protocole

- Discovery
    Let the user take a couple of try with the system to avoid stressing them during the actual test
- test
    The user will be asked to write and format a short text from a provided text from news paper, a short story,...
    This will be done by using either the eye tracked version or not at first.
    Then we'll swap the methode and ask them to repeat the task with a different, but similar length text.
    Both these tasks will be timed and saved, with some user being recorded to try to see the number of hand movement of the keyboard.

- Evaluation
    The user will be then to fill a form to gather their feedback and impression.
    This form will touch upon, personal preferences, potential (does the user feel like they could become more proficient with time), issues and ideas.
    Outside of this user feedback, we will go over the time taken, with the user.
